This is **complete** test suite for **Laravel 5.5** with **Dusk browser tests** enabled on **docker executor runner** in **gitlab**.

**Laravel dusk**? Find more on [laravel site](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/dusk) 

**Gitlab**? Find more on [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) 

**Gitlab Continous Integration CI** ? Find more on [gitlab-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-runner/)

You are encouraged to use this for testing purposes in **gitlab ci environments**, and anywhere else, **MIT license**.

This works out of the box, and is really simple, to set up your own **CI testing environment**

However, you might need to update your project, according to this documentation, so please read carefully....

### **What's included?**

| FRAMEWORK | VERSION |
| --------- | ------- |
| PHP       | 7.1.9.1 |
| Xdebug    | 2.5.5   |
| NGINX     | 1.10.3  |
| NODEJS    | 6.11.3  |
| NPM       | 3.10.10 |
| YARN      | 1.1.0   |
| BOWER     | 1.8.2   |
| PHPUNIT   | 6.3.1   |
| NODE-SASS | 4.5.3   |
| GULP      | 3.9.1   |

### **Available additional commands:**

`configure-laravel` - sets up file permissions, generates laravel key, migrates and seeds db

`start-nginx-ci-project` - configures and starts nginx with php-fpm

### **Databases:**

This build is tested with **mysql**, but also works with other docker db engines

To successfully run mysql add to your test routine:

`services:`

â€‹	`mysql:latest` #or specify version you need for example `mysql:5.7`

And in your .env  or your candidate to use, mark mysql as the corresponding resource (**DB_HOST=mysql**)

### **Usage:**

Make sure your **DuskTestCase** class in /tests/DuskTestCase.php matches all attributes, like drive options, host url, and port, like in this example **[DuskTestCase.php](https://github.com/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci/blob/master/examples/DuskTestCase.php)**  # there are some modifications which **you need to apply!**, these changes should not affect your local dev environment, otherwise there might be something else wrong with your project.

In your .gitlab-ci.yml use this image like:

`image: chilio/laravel-dusk-ci:stable`# you can experiment with other images, which might address your needs.

add script lines:

`- cp .env.example .env`  # remember to have **APP_URL=http://localhost** and **DB_HOST=mysql**

`- configure-laravel` # preparations to run project

`- start-nginx-ci-project`  # Here we start webserver, so this is important before running dusk

Finally you can run all your tests served by nginx | php-fpm via:

`- php artisan dusk`

------

#### Further example script commands (if needed in your case):

`- yarn --network-concurrency 1` # when you have problems with slow connection

`- composer install --prefer-dist --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-progress --no-scripts`


`- bower install --quiet`

`- npm run dev ` or if you are on yarn registry `- yarn run dev `

`- ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit -v --coverage-text --colors --stderr`# to run phpunit with version specified in your project

`- cp phpunit.xml.ci phpunit.xml` # In case you don't want to interfere with your local test environment, `you` can apply this approach for ci tests. Make sure to create phpunit.xml.ci in your project and phpunit.dusk.xml. You can specify 2 separate files for your tests, one for phpunit and one for dusk, you can use examples from this repo or modify them to suite your needs.

### **Examples:**

**[DuskTestCase.php](https://github.com/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci/blob/master/examples/DuskTestCase.php)** # with all modifications to successfully run php artisan dusk tests

**[phpunit.dusk.xml](https://github.com/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci/blob/master/examples/phpunit.dusk.xml)**  # in case, you want to define for your project any custom variables like DBs, Caches etc.

**[phpunit.xml.ci](https://github.com/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci/blob/master/examples/phpunit.xml.ci)** # in case, you want to customize phpunit tests like above.

**[gitlab-ci.yml](https://github.com/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci/blob/master/examples/.gitlab-ci.yml)** # with stages, cache, and artifacts, assuming you are using scripts like "dev" in package.json.




### **Caveats:**

- In your dusk tests remember to use -**>waitFor()** to make sure pages are rendered properly, before test fails.
- This docker has been tested with **gitlab-multi-runner** 9.5.0 version, just for your reference.
- in my scenario using `yarn run dev` instead of `npm run dev`  was **really faster**, but this might not work out of the box and you may need to adapt your project.
- This is automated docker build, although you don't see it in docker hub. You can always find more information regarding this repo on [docker cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/swarm/chilio/repository/registry-1.docker.io/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci/general), [docker store](https://store.docker.com/community/images/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci), or on [github](https://github.com/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci)




### **Possible problems:**
- By default all dusk browser tests are run with **resolution** 1920x720 with color depth 24 (bits), if you need to change that, you only need to add/modify that in your .gitlab-ci.yml in `variables:` section, like for example `SCREEN_RESOLUTION: 1280x720x24`
- if you experience **/bootstrap/autoload.php** errors, make sure your appropriate **phpunit configs** are updated, especially `bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"`
